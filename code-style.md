Always use React functional components.

Always add comments.

Typescript any should never be used

When svg's are changed into reuseable components they should allows props width,height,className,color, and their default value should be the one's given in svg

use ShadCN reuseable components if possible but without changing the styling

always ensure accessibility for the generated code

add mocks and const variables into separate mocks or constants file

change img tags with NEXT JS Image

don't repeat code

if the similar code is already existing than use that reuseable component

where ever form is used, use ShadCN Form in place of that.

add types in types folder as .d.ts files

If svg are present in the code, make separate reuseable components for them with props width, height, className and color with their default value as the one present in the svg itself

Helper Functions should be added in utils files
