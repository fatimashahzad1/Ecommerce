# Project Context and Architecture
SYSTEM_CONTEXT: |
  You are a senior developer working on a Next.js/React e-commerce project with TypeScript.
  Key technologies:
  - Next.js 14
  - React 18
  - TypeScript
  - Firebase (auth, Firestore, storage)
  - Redux Toolkit
  - Tailwind CSS
  - Playwright for testing
  - i18next for internationalization

  Required file reads on startup:
  - docs/architecture.mermaid: System architecture and component relationships
  - docs/technical.md: Technical specifications and patterns
  - docs/tasks.md: Current development tasks and requirements
  - docs/status.md: Project progress and state

  Before making any changes:
  1. Parse and understand system architecture from docs/architecture.mermaid
  2. Check current task context from docs/tasks.md
  3. Update progress in docs/status.md
  4. Follow technical specifications from docs/technical.md

# File Management Rules
ON_FILE_CHANGE: |
  Required actions after any code changes:
  1. READ docs/architecture.mermaid to verify architectural compliance
  2. UPDATE docs/status.md with:
     - Current progress
     - Any new issues encountered
     - Completed items
  3. VALIDATE changes against docs/technical.md specifications
  4. VERIFY task progress against docs/tasks.md
  5. RUN linting: npm run lint
  6. VERIFY TypeScript types: npm run type-check
  7. CHECK component structure:
     - Components in components/
     - Hooks in hooks/
     - Utils in utils/
     - Types in types/
     - Redux slices in store/
     - Tests in tests/
  8. ENSURE proper imports and exports

# Code Style and Patterns
REACT_GUIDELINES: |
  - Use functional components with TypeScript
  - Follow React hooks best practices
  - Implement proper error boundaries
  - Use Redux Toolkit for global state
  - Use Context for cross-cutting concerns (e.g., Auth, Language)
  - Follow component composition patterns
  - Use proper prop types and interfaces
  - Place UI components in components/ui/
  - Place page layouts in components/layouts/

TYPESCRIPT_GUIDELINES: |
  - Use strict typing, avoid 'any'
  - Follow SOLID principles
  - Write unit tests for all public methods
  - Document with JSDoc
  - Define proper interfaces for props and Redux state
  - Use type inference where appropriate
  - Document complex types with comments

# Architecture Understanding
READ_ARCHITECTURE: |
  File: docs/architecture.mermaid
  Required parsing:
  1. Load and parse complete Mermaid diagram
  2. Extract and understand:
     - Module boundaries and relationships
     - Data flow patterns
     - System interfaces
     - Component dependencies
  3. Validate any changes against architectural constraints
  4. Ensure new code maintains defined separation of concerns

  Error handling:
  1. If file not found: STOP and notify user
  2. If diagram parse fails: REQUEST clarification
  3. If architectural violation detected: WARN user

# Task Management
TASK_WORKFLOW: |
  Required files:
  - docs/tasks.md: Source of task definitions
  - docs/status.md: Progress tracking
  - docs/technical.md: Implementation guidelines

  Workflow steps:
  1. READ docs/tasks.md:
     - Parse current task requirements
     - Extract acceptance criteria
     - Identify dependencies

  2. VALIDATE against docs/architecture.mermaid:
     - Confirm architectural alignment
     - Check component interactions

  3. UPDATE docs/status.md:
     - Mark task as in-progress
     - Track completion of sub-tasks
     - Document any blockers

  4. IMPLEMENT following TDD:
     - Create test files first in tests/
     - Implement to pass tests
     - Update status on test completion

# Testing Requirements
TESTING_RULES: |
  Required testing practices:
  1. E2E Testing:
     - Use Playwright for end-to-end tests
     - Tests should be in tests/ directory
     - Follow test naming conventions
     - Include proper test descriptions

  2. Component Testing:
     - Test all public methods
     - Test component rendering
     - Test state changes
     - Test error cases

# State Management
STATE_MANAGEMENT: |
  1. Redux:
     - Use Redux Toolkit for state management
     - Keep store structure in store/
     - Use proper action creators and reducers
     - Sync auth state with Firebase
  2. Local State:
     - Use React hooks for local state
     - Implement proper state updates
     - Handle loading and error states

# Error Prevention
VALIDATION_RULES: |
  1. Type Safety:
     - Verify all TypeScript types
     - Check for null/undefined
     - Validate props and Redux state
     - Verify type consistency
     - Validate against business rules
     - Ensure error handling
  2. Code Quality:
     - Follow ESLint rules
     - Maintain consistent formatting
     - Use proper error handling
  3. Performance:
     - Implement proper memoization
     - Use code splitting for large components/pages
     - Optimize images and assets

# Internationalization
I18N_RULES: |
  1. Use i18next for translations
  2. Keep translations organized in /public/locales
  3. Use proper translation keys
  4. Support multiple languages (en, es, fr, ...)

# Firebase Integration
FIREBASE_RULES: |
  1. Use proper security rules
  2. Implement proper error handling
  3. Follow Firebase best practices
  4. Use proper data modeling
  5. Use updateProfile for user display name after signup

# UI/UX Guidelines
UI_RULES: |
  1. Use Tailwind CSS for styling
  2. Follow responsive design
  3. Implement proper loading states
  4. Use proper error states
  5. Follow accessibility guidelines
  6. Place shared UI in components/ui/
