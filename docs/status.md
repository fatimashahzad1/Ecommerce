3. Add proper error handling and loading states
4. Write comprehensive tests
5. Update documentation

## Blockers

- None currently

## Notes

- All features should be tested before deployment
- Documentation needs to be updated as features are completed
- Code review required for all pull requests
- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Implement proper error handling
- Add loading states for all async operations

**Update [DATE]:**

- MainHeader now displays a skeleton matching the header layout when authentication is loading (uses loading from useAuth).
- Skeleton uses the shared Skeleton component and matches the actual header structure for seamless UX.
- Implementation follows technical, architectural, and UI guidelines. No blockers encountered.
